Title:Student Management System
This Java MVC project deals with the management of student database along with a set of features to help in updating the student's credentials and deleting
the details of the student from the database,while having a display function to show all the student details.


Description:
*MVC (Model-View-Controller) is Implemented using Spring Java Framework.
*We will create attributes in view part to take input from the user to store the Student details.
*The controller connects that view to model, model will take the user input, do the updates.
*Changes are updated in view by the help of controller.
*Controller acts like bridge between the view and model.
*We created the 3 columns to store the database, the user input will be stored in MySql database.
*When the user wants to transmit or receive data, the Controller responds by asking or sending the data from the Model.
After that, the Controller sends the result (success or error) back to the View.
View also operated via the Controller,enquiring about the data or adding it to the Model.
Finally, the Controller validates the data for updating by the Mode.
